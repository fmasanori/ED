Selection Test 2013 Facebook Hackaton
Given two positive integers n and k,
generate all binary integer between
0 and 2 ** n-1, inclusive.
These binaries will be drawn in
descending order according to the
number of existing 1s.
If there is a tie choose the lowest
numerical value.
Return the k-th element from the
selected list.
Eg n = 3 and k = 5
['0 b111 ', '0 b11', '0 B101 ',
'0 b110', '0 b1 ', '0 b10',
'0 b100 ', '0 b0']
fifth element '0 b1 '
